Build/Run
=========
1. Install golang (http://golang.org)
    When $GOPATH is not set, it refers to $HOME/go/

2. Install sqlite3 so you can run the sqlite3 command

3. clone the repository to your $GOPATH/go/src
   (default should just be to place it in $HOME/go/src, so the files are 
   within $HOME/go/src/e212/)

4. Install dependencies in vendor folder
   go mod vendor

5. cd $HOME/go/src/e212/

6. build the app:
    make

7. Add a user(admin with password admin)  and initialize the database:
    ./e212_cmd newuser admin admin@example.com admin

8. (Optional) Add E212 entries from ITU (Note, there can be some constraint violation
              due to duplicated entries from the ITU website)
    sqlite3 mccmnc.db < e212.sql

9. Run the app:
    ./e212

10. Visit the website at http://localhost:4000
    (Admin login can use the user:admin password:admin for the user created above)

Develop
=======
The app is developed in Linux in Visual Studio Code.
Install VSCode, and install the Go extensions.
Open the $GOPATH/go/e212/ folder.

TODO
====
* Move to github.com/noselasd/e212 and Use full import paths -
so project can also be fetched with go get
* Use ajax for form posts
* Make the About page
* Make documentation for the Json API
